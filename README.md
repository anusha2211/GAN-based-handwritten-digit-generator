# GAN-based-handwritten-digit-generator
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to generate realistic MNIST handwritten digit images. The model trains a CNN-based Generator and Discriminator to synthesize clear and distinct digit images from random noise, demonstrating the power of generative AI.
